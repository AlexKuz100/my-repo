I`ve got You under my skin
I`ve got You deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that`s you`re really a part of me 
I`ve got You under my skin

I`ve tried so - not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
but why should i try to resisit when,baby,I know so well
 I`ve got You under my skin
